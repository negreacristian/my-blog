    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm Cristian, a developer who enjoys building simple, meaningful web projects. This blog is where I share things I'm learning â€” from front-end basics to DevOps, Docker, and automation workflows.</p>

    <p>My goal is to stay curious, learn in public, and maybe help someone else along the way.</p>

    <h2>Topics I write about:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Web Development (HTML, CSS, JS)</li>
      <li>DevOps and CI/CD workflows</li>
      <li>Learning AWS & GitHub Actions</li>
      <li>Tools and productivity</li>
    </ul>
